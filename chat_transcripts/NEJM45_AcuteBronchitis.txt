CareRecommendation:
Self Care

WhereToSeekCare:
Monitor at home with supportive care measures

LikelyCause:
Post-viral cough following upper respiratory infection

KeyActions:
â€¢ Use honey (1-2 teaspoons) to soothe throat and reduce cough â€¢ Stay well hydrated with warm liquids like herbal tea â€¢ Consider dextromethorphan (Robitussin DM) 15mg every 4 hours if cough disrupts sleep â€¢ Use a humidifier or breathe steam from hot shower â€¢ Get adequate rest to support recovery

WhatToExpect:
Post-viral coughs typically resolve within 2-3 weeks but can persist up to 8 weeks. Your cough should gradually decrease in frequency and intensity.

Warnings:
Seek medical care if you develop fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, blood in mucus, or if cough worsens significantly or persists beyond 8 weeks.
