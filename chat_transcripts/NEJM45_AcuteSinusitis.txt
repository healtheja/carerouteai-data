CareRecommendation:
Doctor Visit

WhereToSeekCare:
Primary care doctor or ENT specialist within 3-5 days

LikelyCause:
Bacterial sinusitis (sinus infection)

KeyActions:
â€¢ Stop OTC decongestant after 3 days total use to avoid rebound congestion â€¢ Use saline nasal rinses 2-3 times daily â€¢ Apply warm compresses to cheeks for 10-15 minutes â€¢ Take ibuprofen (Advil) 400mg every 6-8 hours for pain and inflammation â€¢ Stay well hydrated with warm fluids

WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Your doctor will examine your nose and sinuses, possibly using a nasal scope. They may order a CT scan if symptoms persist. Expect prescription antibiotics like amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7-10 days, plus stronger decongestants or nasal steroid sprays.

Warnings:
Seek immediate care if you develop severe headache, vision changes, high fever, neck stiffness, or swelling around your eyes - these could indicate serious complications.
