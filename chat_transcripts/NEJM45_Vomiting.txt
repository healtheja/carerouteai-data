My 2-year-old son Jack has a low-grade fever and has vomited a couple of times today.

How high is Jack's fever and when did the vomiting start?

His temperature was 100.5Â°F when I checked about an hour ago. He first threw up early this morningâ€”around 7 a.m.â€”and again about an hour later. I gave him a little apple juice in a sippy cup just now and he vomited that up immediately.

Is Jack still producing wet diapers? When was his last wet diaper?

He had a wet diaper about three hours ago, and it was moderately wetâ€”so he is still making urine, just maybe not as much as usual.

Has Jack been around anyone who's been sick recently, or has he been to daycare, playgroups, or other places with children?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
He goes to daycare during the week, and I know a couple of the kids there have had colds lately, so itâ€™s possible he picked something up from them.

Have you given Jack any fever reducers like Tylenol or Motrin today, and if so, when and how much?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
I havenâ€™t given him any Tylenol or Motrin yet today. I wanted to see if the fever stayed low first.

How long has Jack been potty trained, and is he showing any signs of dehydration like dry mouth, no tears when crying, or sunken eyes?

Heâ€™s not potty trained yetâ€”he still wears diapers. I havenâ€™t noticed any real signs of dehydration: his lips and mouth look moist, he had tears when he got upset after vomiting, and his eyes donâ€™t look sunken.
