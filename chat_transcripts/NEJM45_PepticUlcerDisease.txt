CareRecommendation:
Doctor Visit

WhereToSeekCare:
Primary care doctor or gastroenterologist within 1-2 weeks

LikelyCause:
Peptic ulcer disease (stomach or duodenal ulcer)

KeyActions:
â€¢ Continue ranitidine as prescribed â€¢ Take antacids when pain occurs â€¢ Eat smaller, more frequent meals â€¢ Avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen or aspirin â€¢ Keep a food diary to identify triggers

WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Your doctor will likely order blood tests to check for H. pylori bacteria and anemia. You may need an upper endoscopy to directly view your stomach lining. Treatment typically involves proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole and possibly antibiotics if H. pylori is found.

Warnings:
Seek immediate care if you develop severe pain, vomiting blood, black tarry stools, or signs of bleeding
