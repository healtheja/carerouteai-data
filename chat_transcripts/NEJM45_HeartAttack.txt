I need to assess your chest pain immediately. When did this chest pain start and how would you rate it on a scale of 1-10?

ðŸ‘¤ User:
24 hours ago, it was 8/10 when it started now it seems like it is getting worse

ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
This sounds very concerning. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or pain radiating to your arm, jaw, or back right now?

Options: [Shortness of breath | Nausea or vomiting | Sweating | Pain in arm | Pain in jaw | Pain in back | None of these | Other symptoms - I'll specify]
