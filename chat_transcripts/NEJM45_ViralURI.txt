CareRecommendation:
Self Care
WhereToSeekCare:
Monitor at home, see doctor if symptoms worsen
LikelyCause:
Common cold (viral upper respiratory infection)
KeyActions:
â€¢ Continue throat lozenges and cough syrup as needed â€¢ Drink plenty of warm fluids like tea with honey â€¢ Get adequate rest and sleep â€¢ Use saline nasal rinse twice daily â€¢ Consider reducing smoking temporarily to help healing
WhatToExpectWithSelfCare:
Symptoms typically peak around day 3-4 and gradually improve over 7-10 days. Runny nose may change from clear to yellow/green briefly - this is normal. Swollen lymph nodes should shrink as your body fights the infection.
WhenToSeekCare:
â€¢ Fever above 101Â°F (38.3Â°C) â€¢ Severe throat pain making swallowing very difficult â€¢ Symptoms getting significantly worse after day 5 â€¢ Shortness of breath or chest pain â€¢ Lymph nodes becoming very large or painful
SmokingConsideration:
Your smoking may slow healing and increase risk of complications like bronchitis. Consider this an opportunity to reduce or quit - even temporary reduction helps your immune system recover faster.
