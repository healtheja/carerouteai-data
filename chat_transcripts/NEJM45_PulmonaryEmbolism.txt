ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Given your symptoms - sudden shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with breathing, and leg pain/swelling - you need emergency medical care immediately. These symptoms together suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung), which is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.
