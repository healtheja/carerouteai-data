Doctor Visit

WhereToSeekCare:
Primary care doctor or urgent care within 1-2 days

LikelyCause:
Bacterial respiratory tract infection (likely bronchitis)

KeyActions:
â€¢ Stay well hydrated with water and warm fluids â€¢ Use a humidifier or breathe steam from hot shower â€¢ Get plenty of rest to support recovery â€¢ Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650mg every 6 hours for body aches if needed â€¢ Avoid cough suppressants as productive cough helps clear infection

WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Your doctor will likely listen to your lungs, may order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia, and will probably prescribe antibiotics like amoxicillin or azithromycin for the bacterial infection
