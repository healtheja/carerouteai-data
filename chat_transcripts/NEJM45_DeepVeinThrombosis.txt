CareRecommendation:
Emergency Care

WhereToSeekCare:
Emergency Room immediately for urgent evaluation

LikelyCause:
Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot)

KeyActions:
â€¢ Go to ER now - do not delay â€¢ Avoid massaging or rubbing the leg â€¢ Stay hydrated while waiting â€¢ Bring list of current medications if possible

WhatToExpectAtER:
â€¢ Blood tests (D-dimer, CBC) to check clotting â€¢ Ultrasound of your leg to visualize blood flow â€¢ Possible CT scan if pulmonary embolism suspected â€¢ Blood thinning medication if clot confirmed â€¢ Admission may be needed for monitoring

Warnings:
Seek immediate care if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing up blood - these could indicate the clot has traveled to your lungs
