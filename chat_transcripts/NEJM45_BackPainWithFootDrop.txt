Lower back pain and my left foot is weakâ€”it keeps dropping and I canâ€™t lift my toes.

How long have you been experiencing the back pain and foot weakness?

The low back pain started about 3 weeks ago after I shoveled snow. The left foot weakness and trouble lifting my toes started about a week ago.

On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your back pain right now, and does it radiate down your leg?

About a 6 out of 10 right now. Yes, it shoots from my lower back into my left buttock and down the back/side of my left leg toward the calf and top of my foot.

Can you walk normally, or do you notice your left foot slapping down when you walk?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
Yeah, my left foot slaps down when I walk, and I have to lift my knee higher to avoid tripping.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
What makes your back pain worse, and what helps relieve it?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
Bending, lifting, twisting, or sitting for a long time makes it worse. Coughing or sneezing can also send a jolt down my left leg. Lying down, gentle walking, using a heating pad, and doing light stretches seem to help a bit.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Can you feel light touch normally on your left leg and foot, or are there areas of numbness?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
I can feel light touch normally on my left leg and foot. I havenâ€™t noticed any numb patches.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Can you stand on your tiptoes with both feet, and can you walk on your heels normally?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
I can stand on my tiptoes with both feet. But I canâ€™t walk on my heels on the left side because I canâ€™t lift my toes up.

------------------------------------------------------------

No, nothing else besides the shoveling.

What's your occupation, and does it involve heavy lifting or prolonged sitting?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
Mostly prolonged sitting; no heavy lifting.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Have you noticed any weakness in your left leg muscles besides the foot drop, such as difficulty standing from a chair or climbing stairs?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
No, other than the foot drop. I can stand up from a chair and climb stairs normally; itâ€™s mainly lifting my left foot/toes thatâ€™s weak.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Does the pain or weakness get worse with certain positions like sitting forward, or does leaning on a shopping cart help when walking?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
Sitting forward or slouching makes it worse. Leaning on a shopping cart doesnâ€™t really help; it still hurts and the foot weakness is the same.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Have you tried any over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and if so, did they help?

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ User:
I took ibuprofen a couple of times. It eased the back pain a bit, but it didnâ€™t change the foot weakness.

------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“± CareRoute AI:
Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function, such as difficulty controlling urination or bowel movements?

------------------------------------------------------------

No, no changes. Urination and bowel movements are normal, no trouble controlling them.

WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Your doctor will perform neurological tests, check reflexes, and likely order an MRI to confirm L5 nerve compression. Treatment may include physical therapy, stronger anti-inflammatories, or steroid injections.
