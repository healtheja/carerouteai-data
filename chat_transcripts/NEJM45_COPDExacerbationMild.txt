CareRecommendation:
Doctor Visit
WhereToSeekCare:
Primary care doctor within 3-5 days
LikelyCause:
Chronic bronchitis with acute exacerbation
KeyActions:
â€¢ Stop smoking immediately - this is critical for healing â€¢ Use a humidifier or breathe steam from hot shower â€¢ Stay hydrated with warm fluids like tea or broth â€¢ Avoid cold air and cover nose/mouth when going outside â€¢ Get plenty of rest
WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Your doctor will likely order a chest X-ray and breathing tests (spirometry). They may prescribe bronchodilators (inhalers like albuterol), steroids to reduce inflammation, and discuss smoking cessation programs. Blood tests may check for infection markers.
SmokingCessation:
Quitting smoking is essential - your 40-year, 1-2 pack daily habit is the primary cause. Ask your doctor about nicotine replacement therapy, prescription medications like Chantix, or smoking cessation programs.
Warnings:
Seek emergency care if you develop severe shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, high fever, or coughing up blood. If breathing worsens significantly, don't wait for your appointment.
