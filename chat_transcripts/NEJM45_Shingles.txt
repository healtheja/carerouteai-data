CareRecommendation:
Doctor Visit

WhereToSeekCare:
Primary care doctor or urgent care within 1-2 days

LikelyCause:
Shingles (herpes zoster reactivation)

KeyActions:
â€¢ Take ibuprofen 400mg every 6-8 hours for pain â€¢ Apply cool, damp compresses for 15-20 minutes â€¢ Keep rash clean and dry â€¢ Avoid scratching or picking at blisters â€¢ Wear loose-fitting cotton clothing

WhatToExpectAtDoctorVisit:
Doctor will examine the rash pattern and likely prescribe antiviral medication (like valacyclovir) to shorten duration and reduce complications. May also prescribe stronger pain medication and discuss prevention of postherpetic neuralgia.

TimeImportance:
Antiviral treatment is most effective when started within 72 hours of rash onset. Since you're at day 5, seeing a doctor promptly is still beneficial for pain management and preventing complications.

Warnings:
Seek immediate care if you develop: severe eye pain, vision changes, difficulty breathing, or signs of bacterial infection (increased redness, warmth, pus, red streaking).
