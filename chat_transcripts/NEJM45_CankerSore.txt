I keep getting painful sores inside my mouth, there are a few right now on the inside of my cheeks.

📱 CareRoute AI:
How long have you had these current sores, and have you experienced mouth sores like this before?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
They started about three days ago. I’ve been getting similar mouth sores every couple of months since I was little.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
How many sores do you currently have, and what do they look like - size, color, and shape?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
I can see about five of them right now. Each is a small round spot, maybe 3-4 millimeters across, with a whitish-yellow center and a red rim around it.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
On a scale of 1-10, how painful are these sores, and do they interfere with eating or drinking?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
I’d call the pain about a 6 out of 10. It stings more when I eat spicy or acidic foods, so I’m trying to avoid those, but I can still eat and drink otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
What's your age and have you noticed any triggers that seem to bring on these mouth sores?

👤 User:
I’m 17. I’m not totally sure what sets them off, but they do seem to pop up more often when I’m stressed out with school, and occasionally after I accidentally bite the inside of my cheek.

📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you have any food allergies or sensitivities, and have you noticed if certain foods seem to trigger your mouth sores?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
I don’t have any known food allergies. I have noticed that citrus or really spicy foods can make the sores sting more once they’re already there, but I’m not sure those foods actually cause them in the first place.

------------------------------------------------------------

Besides the mouth sores, do you have any other symptoms like fever, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, or skin rashes?

They’re usually gone within about a week, maybe ten days at most, and once they heal the skin looks completely normal—no scarring or marks left behind.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Have you ever seen a doctor or dentist about these mouth sores, or tried any treatments for them?

------------------------------------------------------------

I haven’t gone to a doctor or dentist for this episode. I usually just rinse with warm salt water and sometimes use one of those over-the-counter numbing gels—nothing prescription.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you use any specific toothpaste brand, and have you noticed if switching toothpastes affects your mouth sores?

I usually use regular Crest toothpaste with fluoride—sometimes Colgate if that’s what’s in the bathroom. I haven’t really noticed any difference in how often I get the sores when I switch between them.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you smoke, vape, use tobacco products, or drink alcohol?

Options: [None of these | Smoking cigarettes | Vaping/e-cigarettes | Chewing tobacco or snuff | Drinking alcohol | Other - I'll specify]

None of these

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Have you had any recent dental work, orthodontic adjustments, or injuries to your mouth?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
No recent dental work or braces adjustments. The only “injury” was that I accidentally bit my cheek about a week ago while eating, but that’s it.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Have you been under more stress than usual lately with school, relationships, or other life events?

Yeah, midterms are coming up, so the past couple of weeks have definitely been more stressful than normal.

📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you have any allergies to medications, and have you noticed if your mouth sores get worse during certain seasons or times of year?

I don’t have any medication allergies that I know of, and I haven’t noticed any particular time of year when the sores are worse—they seem to show up randomly.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you get adequate sleep, and have you noticed if lack of sleep seems to coincide with when you get mouth sores?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
I normally try to get around 7-8 hours a night, but during big exam weeks it drops to maybe 5-6 hours. It does seem like I’m more likely to get these sores when I’m short on sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Have you ever had any blood tests done, and do you take any nutritional supplements like B vitamins, iron, or zinc?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
No, I’ve never had any blood work done specifically for these sores—just the usual basic blood panel at my annual physical and everything was normal. I don’t take any supplements like B-vitamins, iron, or zinc.

------------------------------------------------------------
📱 CareRoute AI:
Do you eat a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and protein, or do you have any dietary restrictions that might limit certain nutrients?

------------------------------------------------------------
👤 User:
I’d say it’s pretty balanced—lots of regular meals at home with meat or chicken, vegetables, some fruit, and whole-grain bread or rice. I’m not on any special diet and I don’t cut out any major food groups.
